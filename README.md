# TMF672_UserRolesPermissions
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) User Roles and Permissions Management API

A user role is defined as the entity that defines a set of privileges covering various
functions and/or manageable assets. When a user is assigned  a given role then it is
actually allocated all the privileges defined for that roletype and the corresponding
permissions are created for that user.
